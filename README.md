# PDFicator

A hacky workspace for developing workflows to analyze a massive (+80k) collection of PDF documents.

The idea is, give the tool a massive directory of PDF files, and extract data from it.

This project will start off with a few hacky python experiments, but the eventual goal is to build an app that is worthy of the collection.  

Different approaches will be taken towards the goal of mining the data - static analysis, extraction, and eventual use in ML is intended.
